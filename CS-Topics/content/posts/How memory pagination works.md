Hello everyone! My name is Costantino. I’m a computer science student and a tech enthusiast. The main purpose of this blog is to explore and share insights on some of the most exciting topics in the fascinating world of computer science.

Let me start by explaining how I write and manage this blog.

I primarily take notes in Obsidian, though I’m currently evaluating Emacs’ Org mode as a possible alternative. For the blog itself, I decided to use Markdown for content creation and Hugo as a powerful static site generator. Hugo not only offers a modern UI but also provides handy scripts that make the update process straightforward and efficient.
