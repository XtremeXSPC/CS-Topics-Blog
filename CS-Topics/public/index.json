[{"content":"Hello, and welcome to my corner of the internet! 👋\nI’m a Computer Science student in the Department of Computer Science at University of Bari Aldo Moro. My passion for technology is boundless, especially when it involves anything programmable. From writing simple scripts to tackling complex systems, I find joy in turning ideas into working code.\nWhat Drives Me 🚀 I have a particular interest in concurrent systems. Understanding how processes interact, synchronize, and scale fascinates me, and I aim to dive deeper into these aspects through this blog. I believe sharing insights and learning publicly is one of the best ways to grow and refine one\u0026rsquo;s knowledge.\nHere, you’ll find thoughts, experiments, and explorations into:\nParallel and concurrent programming System design principles Programming paradigms and best practices My Toolbelt 🛠️ I enjoy programming in multiple languages, each offering its own strengths and philosophies. Here’s what I currently work with:\nC, C++: For performance and systems programming Java, Kotlin: When robust, platform-independent applications are the goal Rust: Because memory safety and concurrency can coexist beautifully Python: For scripting, data analysis, and automation Go: When simplicity and speed meet concurrency I am always eager to learn new tools and technologies that expand my horizons.\nMy Philosophy: Free and Open 🌍 I’m a strong believer in Free Software and a proud user of Linux. Open-source communities inspire me, and I try to contribute whenever possible. I believe that software should empower users, not limit them.\nLet’s Connect! 🌐 Whether you’re passionate about programming, open-source software, or concurrent systems, I’d love to hear from you! Let’s exchange ideas, collaborate, and grow together.\nThank you for stopping by, and I hope you enjoy exploring my blog! 🧑‍💻\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/about/","summary":"about","title":"About Me"}]
